      <h2>The Secretary’s Roles and Responsibilities </h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        The secretary of a group is a trusted member who has decided to take on
        the responsibility of managing the app and the monthly funds for their
        group. The secretary is responsible for a) determining the value of
        coverage and the associated premium; b) maintaining a cushion of
        $2,000.00 for conversions to and from DAI; c) converting group funds to
        DAI in the beginning of the monthly cycle and US dollars at the end of
        the cycle; d) carrying out the will of the group in whitelisting or
        rejecting claims; and e) monitoring the active members of the group in
        the app, removing defectors or members who decide to leave. While the
        secretary should definitely be someone that the group trusts, the
        secretary does not make decisions for the group. If you cannot trust the
        secretary will whitelist your valid claim, you should not join the
        group. If you have any doubt that the group will pay your claim after
        the secretary whitelists your claim, you should be hesitant about
        participation.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        To figure out what your premium will be, first take the value of a
        single claim and multiply it by the number of claims you want to pay
        each month. Now that you have the maximum value of claims per month, you
        need to divide that amount by the number of people in the group. That
        will tell us the premium each member will be paying. The secretary
        converts the US dollars into DAI on a person-by-person basis. So when
        you need DAI, you will contact your secretary either in person, by chat,
        or by phone. If a claim is made, the secretary will initiate the
        investigation process. The very first step is opening a chat room where
        a Google doc link is posted which contains all relevant information on
        the claim, and where all the members are free to discuss the claim.
        Secretaries make the final determination on whether claims are
        whitelisted, but they do not force any member to pay a claim they
        believe is invalid. The entire group (including the secretary) will
        review the evidence that the claimant provides and will use their
        charter to come to a consensus. If a claim is whitelisted, then the
        members will be responsible to finalize their payment to the claimant.
        If a claim is not whitelisted, it can never be paid by the group. It is
        the secretary’s responsibility to whitelist or reject the claim in the
        app. Once the claimant gets their claim award in DAI, they will want to
        convert this to USD. The secretary converts the claimant’s DAI back to
        US dollars. If there is no claim, the members’ DAI is used to pay the
        next month’s premium. If any members have defected (see “Defecting:
        Meaning and Consequences) or left the group, the secretary is
        responsible for removing them from the group in the app.
      </p>
      <br></br>

      <br></br>
      <p>
        The secretary’s most important role is to coordinate the members of the
        group to whitelist valid claims and to serve as a conversion point if
        needed, so that members can move between DAI and USD. The secretary the
        leader of the group, and a member that ideally everyone trusts to be
        organized, responsible, somewhat tech savvy (though the app does most of
        the work), and to act in accordance with the rest of the group’s wishes.
        Take note that at no time does the secretary have access to any funds
        other than their own (see “A Brief Overview of How TandaPay Works” for
        more information).
