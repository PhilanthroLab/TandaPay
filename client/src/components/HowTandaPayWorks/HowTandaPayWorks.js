      <h2>A Brief Overview of How TandaPay Works</h2>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        TandaPay is an app that allows people to form groups of up to 50 to pool
        money together to pay out awards or claims for specific agreed-upon
        covered events, such as paid time off for employees in industries that
        don’t offer PTO, incidental emergencies that might come up like having
        to pay an insurance deductible, or even bail money for activist groups
        to bail each other out in the event of arrest. The beauty of TandaPay is
        that it allows groups to pool their money using smart contracts, which
        means that no one member has access to other member’s funds and prevents
        the need to obtain licensure. TandaPay can also be thought of as
        person-to-person insurance that pays out monthly claim awards where the
        total for all awards in a given month is limited to $2,000.00. The
        concept for TandaPay groups is based on tandas, groups of friends and
        family members who pool their money to give each other informal
        short-term loans.

        When a TandaPay group is formed, members approve a charter to identify
        covered events, what type of evidence will be required to prove a claim,
        and other important terms for the group. The app utilizes a stable
        cryptocurrency called DAI to pay premiums and award claims. Think about
        DAI as a digital dollar, the app will tell you how many dollars you
        have. Using the blockchain, there will be a permanent record of the
        group’s activity published online, which will have many potential
        benefits. Each month, the number of people who paid premiums in a
        TandaPay group as well as the number of claims that are whitelisted and
        paid out are digitally recorded onto the blockchain, which no person or
        entity can erase after the fact.

        To function successfully, TandaPay groups should be formed between
        people who know each other in real life and who have similar views
        regarding the common issues that caused the group to form. You already
        know who your secretary is. They are the ones who invited you to
        participate in this group. The secretary will serve as the conversion
        point to allow you to obtain DAI to pay your premiums or obtain dollars
        if you receive a claim award. Their main function beyond conversion is
        to coordinate the group to approve claims (see the “Responsibilities of
        a Secretary to Their Group” for more on secretaries). Monthly premiums
        are paid in US dollars, then converted into DAI. Because DAI is a stable
        cryptocurrency, the value does not fluctuate more than a penny from the
        value of a dollar. There are two outcomes every month: 1) a valid claim
        or claims are whitelisted and paid out using the group’s premiums or 2)
        the premiums are refunded. If more than one valid claim is whitelisted
        in a month, the total amount of premiums are divided by the number of
        claims, and each member with a claim is paid an equal amount. In both
        outcomes, premiums are converted from DAI back to US dollars, and the
        members are repaid in USD. Group members can choose to leave TandaPay
        groups at any time, but they must follow the proper procedure. At
        TandaPay, we believe technology belongs to people and communities rather
        than corporations, and we are working to find ways to make that a
        reality. Power to the people!
