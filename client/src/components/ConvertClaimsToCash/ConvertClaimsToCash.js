        How to convert cash into DAI and claims back to cash using the Secretary
      </h2>

      <p>
        To get cash into TandaPay you don’t need to give the app your bank
        account information, your credit card info or even use other payment
        apps such as Paypal! To get cash into TandaPay you simply need to give
        cash to your secretary. Your secretary is an ATM that allows you to
        convert cash to DAI and DAI to cash. At the same time they receive cash
        from you, you should expect a payment from them in DAI. This payment
        takes a minute or less unless the network is experiencing congestion.
        Your secretary sending money to you via the app is almost as quick and
        easy as if they were to send you a text message. 1 DAI always has the
        value of 1 dollar. Regardless if your account balance displays as $20.00
        or 20.00 DAI you have 20 dollars. You will get a notification from the
        app as soon as you’ve received these funds and then you can know that
        the transaction is complete. Once you’ve received the DAI then please
        pay the secretary the appropriate amount in cash.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Claim awards are always paid out on the 3rd of every month. Schedule a
        time and place to meet up with your secretary to obtain cash once you
        receive your claim award. If you want to pay them using an online method
        such as venmo this may be acceptable depending on your jurisdiction. To
        convert a claim award in DAI to a claim payment in dollars you simply
        need to send the value of your award in DAI to your secretary in
        exchange for a payment in dollars. The secretary should send you the
        value of your claim first in dollars and then once you’ve received this
        value you should then send your claim award in DAI to them. Once you
        perform this action the secretary will receive a notification on their
        phone that the DAI has been received and the transaction is complete.

        innovation without requiring them to give up sensitive information such
        as their banking or credit details.
